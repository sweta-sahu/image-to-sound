# image-to-sound

Images are filtered to meet the requirement of the user. Images are blurred or smoothened for image processing. By using filter one can add or remove colours, can blur or sharpen the image. Every sound you've ever heard can be represented as an image and all possible sounds can be made from an image. It is the ultimate bridge between the graphical world and the audio world, bringing the full power of image editing to the service of creating and transforming sounds. It helps us to create new kinds of sounds never heard before, new effects never approximated, new takes on classical effects or methods, all merely by combining the power of the simple set of tools built in the program.
